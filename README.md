Hospital occupancy rates in Turkey during the Covid-19 process
In this project, I will examine the hospital occupancy rates in the Covid-19 process in Turkey. I will examine the social and economic effects of 'hospital occupancy rates', which is one of the daily available data, on human health. In addition, I will examine the different point of view regarding the management of the process by healthcare professionals and authorities. Was the reason for the increasing hospital density rates in the epidemic process managed in Turkey was the mismanagement of the epidemic or was it the natural course of the epidemic? We can learn the answer to this question together. In this process, I aimed to examine the problems experienced by people in hospitals, the attitude of hospital staff and also the behavior of patients. Thanks to the knowledge and experience I have gained from my daily life, I will present this project to you in the best possible way. I started social studies on people who have been careful since the beginning of the pandemic period and who were vaccinated during the pandemic period, who had or did not have covid-19, and who have never had covid-19. In line with the information I have acquired in this project, I will find the most accurate way to specify hospital density rates on data visualization and add it to my project.
