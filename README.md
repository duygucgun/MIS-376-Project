Hospital occupancy rates in Turkey during the Covid-19 process

Problem

In this project, I will examine the hospital occupancy rates in the Covid-19 process in Turkey. I will examine the social and economic effects of 'hospital occupancy rates', which is one of the daily available data, on human health. In addition, I will examine the different point of view regarding the management of the process by healthcare professionals and authorities. Was the reason for the increasing hospital density rates in the epidemic process managed in Turkey was the mismanagement of the epidemic or was it the natural course of the epidemic? We can learn the answer to this question together. In this process, I aimed to examine the problems experienced by people in hospitals, the attitude of hospital staff and also the behavior of patients. Thanks to the knowledge and experience I have gained from my daily life, I will present this project to you in the best possible way. I started social studies on people who have been careful since the beginning of the pandemic period and who were vaccinated during the pandemic period, who had or did not have covid-19, and who have never had covid-19. In line with the information I have acquired in this project, I will find the most accurate way to specify hospital density rates on data visualization and add it to my project.

Senario

I witnessed the treatment process in the hospital of a relative who caught the coronavirus. The most important problem I encountered during this process was the hospital occupancy rate. Due to the increase in hospital occupancy rates, people could not complete their treatment. Many deaths were due to hospital occupancy. Having witnessed this process, I decided to examine this problem in my project.

Data Sets

I can access these data from many different places, but I have planned to actively collect data on 5 different platforms for certainty.
1.	I will access the Digital Transformation Office website, which has been recently opened by the Presidency of the Republic of Turkey.
2.	Daily data published by the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Turkey during the pandemic process.
3.	The monthly reports of the Turkish Medical Association.
4.	Data published by the World Health Organization.


Data Collection process

While obtaining these data, I was impressed by the disagreements that arose due to Turkey's political and economic situation. I also had to examine and evaluate the data of the Turkish Medical Association, which opposed the data announced by the Ministry of Health. With the chaos, obscurity and shock effect of the epidemic that emerged during the pandemic process, many different approaches emerged. There are many different newspapers, websites, different institutions and organizations where I can access these data. I encountered a lot of information pollution. I tried to use the resources that are on Turkey's agenda.

Visualization Tools

There are some data visualization tools that I will use while doing a detailed analysis of this project. I chose to use the Datawrapper and Visme tools as they are easy to access.
